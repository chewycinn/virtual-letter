            <p id="personal-message"> Dear Shareign my wife,<br><br>
    I donâ€™t really know where to begin, because no words could ever match how I feel about youâ€¦ but Iâ€™ll try anyway.<br><br>
    How are you, pretty baby?<br>
    Have I already told you today that I love everything about you?<br><br>
    And when I say everything, I mean everything from your skin to your pure soul.<br>
    Even the parts of yourself you donâ€™t like... I love those too. The things you see as flaws I see as beautiful pieces of the person I adore.<br><br>
    I love you the way the moon loves to show up in every phase: half, quarter, or full.<br>
    That means I love every version of you, even the darker sides. And Iâ€™ll be here through all of it. I want to give you all that I have, even when you're not at your best.<br><br>
    And in your full moon phase, when youâ€™re feeling your fullest and brightest, I want to be there, cheering you on, building dreams with you, and celebrating every moment until the hard days finally pay off.<br><br>
    I want you to always remember where you came from to look back and reflect on how much you've grown along the way.<br><br>
    And most of all, I want to walk beside you through it all â€” every step, every season, every chapter.<br><br>
    Youâ€™ll never be alone, baby. Iâ€™m yours â€” completely. Always.<br>
    I love you endlessly. ðŸ«¶ðŸŒ™
