            <h2>From: Haneeza Louise (your wife)</h2>
            <h2>To: Shareign my wife <3</h2>
            <p id="personal-message">Dear My wife Shareign,<br><br>I donâ€™t really know where to begin, because no words could ever match how I feel about youâ€¦ but Iâ€™ll try anyway.
How are you, pretty baby?â€¨Have I already told you today that I love everything about you?
And when I say everything, I mean everything from your skin to your pure soul.â€¨Even the parts of yourself you donâ€™t like... I love those too. The things you see as flaws I see as beautiful pieces of the person I adore.
I love you the way the moon loves to show up in every phase: half, quarter, or full.â€¨That means I love every version of you even the darker sides. And Iâ€™ll be here through all of it. I want to give you all that I have, even when you're not at your best.
And in your full moon phase, when youâ€™re feeling your fullest and brightestâ€¨I want to be there, cheering you on, building dreams with you, and celebrating every moment until the hard days finally pay off.
I want you to always remember where you came from to look back and reflect on how much you've grown along the way.
And most of all, I want to walk beside you through it all every step, every season, every chapter.<br><br>You'll never be alone, baby. I'm yours completely Always. I love you endlessly. ðŸ«¶ ðŸŒ™<br>Louise</p>
